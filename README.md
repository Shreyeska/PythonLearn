# Python Practice
This repository is dedicated to my Python practice journey. It serves as a personal space for improving my Python skills, exploring different concepts, and mastering Python programming.

# Motivation
The main goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Python and become proficient in writing efficient and clean Python code. By engaging in regular practice and tackling various programming challenges, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain confidence in my Python programming skills.

# Structure
Each day, a new directory will be created to represent a programming session (e.g., exercise1, exercise2, etc.). Within each directory, you will find Python files containing the code I wrote during that specific programming session.

# Guidelines
* I will attempt to solve different coding challenges, puzzles, or exercises each day. Before referring to any external resources or sample solutions, I will make an earnest effort to solve the problem on my own. After completing a solution, I will test it with various test cases to verify its correctness and efficiency. I will strive to write clean and well-documented code, following Python best practices and coding conventions.

# Progress Tracking
* I will maintain a log in the `Questions.txt` file, which will contain the exercises completed during my Python practice.
* The log will help me track my progress, set goals, and reflect on the areas I need to focus on for improvement.
* I will also add questions from Leetcode with one or few ways to solve it.
